The provided script is designed to be a cross-platform DLL injection mechanism, supporting both Windows and Linux environments. It utilizes preprocessor directives to conditionally compile platform-specific code. For Windows, it incorporates the MinHook library for hooking functions, enabling the interception of the DirectDrawCreateEx function. On Linux, it relies on dynamic linking using dlsym to obtain the original function address. The script includes critical sections for thread safety and a logging mechanism to output information to a log file. The main function initializes the hooks, logs relevant information, and ensures proper cleanup during DLL unloading or process termination. It is crucial to customize the logic inside the hooked function based on the desired functionality, ensuring adherence to legal and compliance standards for each platform.
